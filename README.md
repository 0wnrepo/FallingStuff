Falling Stuff v2.0
==============

This aims to rewrite the "Falling Stuff" screensaver that I wrote years ago (available at https://alum.wpi.edu/~davidl/Falling_Stuff/Falling_Stuff_about.html), and whose implementation was complex, and difficult to maintain.

It's also an excuse for me to learn a bit about newer graphics APIs, such as Apple's Metal.framework.

Enjoy!
